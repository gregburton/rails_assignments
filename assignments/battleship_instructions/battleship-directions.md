# How to Play Battleship: An Oppressively Thorough Guide

## Setup
1. Open the box containing the game contents
  - box should be right-side up
  - lift top lid off of bottom section of box using your hands
  - place top of box next to the bottom of the box

2. You need two players total, so make sure you have one other person to play with.

3. Each player gets one side of the board and is not allowed to look at the other player's section of the board (on the other side of the divider).

4. Each player takes the boat pieces they are provided with in their side of the board and places each (pegs side down) on the lower grid on their side of the board. Once this is done for both players, gameplay can begin.

5. Flip a coin to see who goes first (heads-tails).

6. Player 1 who was selected to go first makes a guess as to where the player 2's boats are located using the coordinates provided on the upper grid (i.e. the one on the divider). [For example, A-3.]
- Player 2 must tell player 1 whether it was a hit or a miss (i.e. if there is a boat at that coordinate).
- For the purposes of keeping track: if a hit, player 1 places a red peg on the upper grid at that coordinate, and player 2 places a red peg in the hole on their boat at that coordinate on their lower grid.
 -If a miss, player 1 places a white peg at that coordinate.
- If player 1's guess was correct, player 1 gets to guess again--this continues until they guess incorrectly or win the game,
-If a player's boat is filled with red pegs, they need to announce to the other player that "you sunk my battleship". Once all of a player's battleships are sunk, the game is over.
7. Same rules apply for player 2's turns, except that for the previous instructions, the player names are reversed.
